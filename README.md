This small repo is my submission of project 1 for the first quarter of the [Self Driving Car Nanodegree at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/drive.  The Jupyter notebook executes a few examples on example images, as well as example videos.  The images are available in `examples/`, however, I've kept the videos out in the interest of space.

I was surprised how straightforward identifying and marking lane lines was when pointed in the right direction by Udacity.  Great course, I highly recommend.
